### Cricket

#### Bat and ball game

#### Two teams of 11 players take turn to bat and bowl.

#### Objective is to score as much runs as possible .

#### Team with most runs wins the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Things To know

#### Innings : Two inning in a game. In 1st innings, one team bat and the other bowls and vice-versa in the second innings.

#### Ball: One throw of the ball by the balling. Similar to pitch in baseball.

#### Over: Six balls make an over.

#### Depending upon the format of game, there are certain number of over available for the teams to bat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Things To know

#### Depending upon the format of game, there are certain number of over available for the teams to bat.

#### The paper uses data from ODIs(One-Day Internationals) that have 50 over each in an innings.

#### The data I have used data from T20s(Twenty-twentys) that have 20 over each in an innings.

#### In these limited overs, the batting teams try to score as runs as possible and the bowling team try to get them out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Things to know

#### The other thing a batting team is limited by is called wickets.

#### Simlar to outs in baseball.

#### There have to be two batsman at the pitch at any given time. So, a team will have 10 wickets each.

#### If a batting team loses all 10 wicket before the avaible overs have been bowled, thw innings is over.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### In the paper by Asif and McHale

#### They use a dynamic logistic regression to calculate the in-game win probability of a game.

#### They used data from 606 ODI matches.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Covariates

### Method
#### They tried to find the series of best independent logistic regression for each k = 299, ...,1, where k is the number of balls remaining. 
#### They used Cross-Validation Delete-d method to identify the best set of covariates that appear at least once in the series of the 299 best logistic models. 
### Once the covariates were finalized, they smoothed all the covariates one by one to come up with the final model.ÃŸ
